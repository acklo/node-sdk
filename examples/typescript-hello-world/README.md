# acklo typescript-hello-world example

This is an example of how to use acklo to remotely manage configuration
of a Node.js CLI application written in TypeScript.

## Running the example

1. Sign up to [acklo](https://acklo.app) and create an application.
1. Replace `[YOUR APPLICATION KEY]` with your application's key in `index.ts`.
1. Install dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
1. Run the CLI app:

   ```shell
   yarn start

   # Or

   yarn start Bobby
   ```

1. Start making changes to the app's config on the acklo UI and you'll see them
   get applied live!
